CHANGELOG:

v0.1.7 BETA: - Fixed a bug that would crash the app when a port was specified. Thx to OK1TEB for notifying me.
	- Added -m flag to enable MessageGate; Warning! Still in beta.
	  CURRENTLY SENDS _ALL_ MESSAGES FROM APRSIS ON PORT 1. THIS IS A LOT
	  OF RF SPAM !!! DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION !!!

v0.1.6: - saxIgate now runs as a deamon when not in verbose mode.
	- Cleaned up #includes to get rid of 'Implicit Declaration' warnings when compiling.
	- saxIgate sends out an ID beacon on connect over TCP/IP only (not on RF).

v0.1.5: - Fixed some memory leaks that caused crash after a few days.
	- Fixed bug that would truncate digipath on some systems.

v0.1.4: - Program now reconnects on disconnect instead of exiting.
	- Caching system added to prevent double data to be send after a digipeater re-airs it.
		
v0.1.3: - Initial release to public (google code) under the GNU License v3.
	- Code cleanup and added comments for my own sake :p I tend to forget what something is for when a project
	  is in the fridge to long.
	- Using STD_ERR for error messages.
	- Actually using the Verbose flag (-v). No output to STD_OUT if omitted.
	- Checking for -p, -c and -s flags! These are required.
	- Fixed bug that would give a Segmentation Fault when NOT running in verbose mode.

v0.1.2: - Added code to connect, login and send data to APRS-IS. Tested with my own APRS-IS server T2BELGIUM 
          running javAPRSSrvr 3.14b05 with 2 live APRS digi's (ON0DAS-4 & ON0BAF-4)
        - Modified ax25 code to also read packages that are locally transmitted (for digi beacons etc)

v0.1.1: - Added callpass generator (code from Xastir) and formatting of ax25 data for I-gate transmission.

v0.1.0: - Initial code to read ax25 messages from the kernel. Code copied from the digi_ned project
          and modified to suit saxIgate needs.
